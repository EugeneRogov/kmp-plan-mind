### Development

To rebuild only the server after code changes:

```bash
docker-compose up --build server
```

## Original Setup

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
    - `commonMain` is for code that's common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple's CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if you're sharing code with other platforms,
  you still need some amount of platform-specific code, for example to set up the UI.

* `/server` contains the backend code powered by Ktor.

* `/shared` contains the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is `commonMain`. If preferred, you can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.
